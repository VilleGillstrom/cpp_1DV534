Step 4



Presistent storage
The persistent storage is a file. BaseCollectionItem have a function that returns the name of a property aswell as the value as strings. FileItemCollectionStorage takes each of these string and store it together with  it's id and BaseCollectionItem's specific type-name. 

When reading from file it uses the type-name to determine which BaseCollectionItem's  class to instantiate. This will becoma a very long if-else statement as the number of items are added. Would probably have to create some kind of factory in the future that items temselves can register to in the future.

User interface
A std::map with each possible option as a key are created for the different menus. The values are callable functions which will run when the key-string is entered by the user. It creates quite a few classes, one for each sub-menu, but each class is pretty clean. 

For example, if an option should open another menu the new value in the function-map would be bound to the new menu's show() function.


Similar to the presisten storage the implementation will become unmaintainable as number of items increase. The options are all hard-coded.
